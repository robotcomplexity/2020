# The Expense of Neuro-Morpho Functional Machines
## 2020
The impact of the environment on the evolution of increasingly complex
morphologies (bodies) and controllers (brains) remains an open
question in evolutionary biology and has
important implications for the evolutionary design of robots that must
function across a
range of environments. This study evaluates the relationship between
between task difficulty (environment complexity) and evolved
morphological and neural complexity given complexity costs in the form
of body and brain energy requirements.  We evolve body-brain couplings
for increasingly difficult cooperative transport tasks in a collective
robotic gathering simulation.  The impact of imposing costs on
morphological and controller complexity during robot body-brain
evolution is evaluated across increasingly complex environments.
Results indicate that imposing morphological and neural (energy) costs
on complexity induces the evolution of robots using simpler
controllers and morphologies but with negligible behavior (task
performance) differences in simple environments.
However, increased neural and morphological complexity was beneficial
as environment complexity increased.
